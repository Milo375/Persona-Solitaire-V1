___What are the controls to your game? How do we play?___
Mouse - Click on cards to interact.
A target card will be displayed in the middle of the screen. Search face-up cards in your hand (the bottom rows of cards) for cards that are of identical rank, or adjacent (+1 or -1) to play on top of the target card. More of your hand will be revealed as you use cards in upper rows. If nothing can be played, draw a new target card from the draw pile in the top right of the screen. If you manage to clear all cards in your hand, you win. If you cannot before the draw pile is exhausted, you lose.

___What creative additions did you make? How can we find them?___
I have completely redesigned the art to be entirely Persona 5 styled. The font and background have been changed, and all of the face cards have been turned into representations of the characters from the game. I took the art from the game and transformed it to be card-like. The card backs are the "Take Your Heart" calling cards from in the Persona 5 game. There is also background music that changes to more intense versions upon winning rounds in succession. 

___Any assets used that you didn't create yourself? (art, music, etc. Just tell us where you got it, link it here)___
Yes, background image, font, music, icons, and images are all from the game Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal.

___Did you receive help from anyone outside this class? (list their names and what they helped with)___
N/A

___Did you get help from any online websites, videos, or tutorials? (link them here)___
N/A

___What trouble did you have with this project?___
Not much, I felt that this second half of the project was much easier than the first half.

___Is there anything else we should know?___
I know that not much credit can be given for assets from other games, but I did editing in GIMP for most of the images to turn them into cards. ;)
